# ODIN MODE (SVB Fail)! Fix

Is your Samsung Galaxy device stuck at `ODIN MODE (SVB Fail)!` blue screen after a software update? Are you stuck in a power loop with no access to recovery mode?

This guide will help you fix it.

(This guide is **only** meant for people having this exact issue).

In my case i have a `Galaxy Tab S9+ FE (WiFi)`. and this methode worked for me.

## Requirements
- [Odin software](https://odindownload.com/) (Version 3.13.1 recommended).
- Install [Android USB drivers](https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver) on your computer.
- Download the latest firmware for your device from [SamFW](https://samfw.com/).
  - **Ensure you download the correct firmware** for your country and device type (4G, 5G, WiFi, etc.).
  For example, my device (as i live in Europe) i choose this firmware:

  So Choose the right frimware for your device **wisely**.

## Steps to Fix ODIN MODE (SVB Fail)
1. **Install** Android USB drivers and restart your computer.
2. **Open Odin**, then connect your device to the computer using a USB data cable.
   - Odin should recognize it as `COM [number]`.
3. **Extract** the downloaded firmware; you should have 4 to 5 files:
   - `BL`, `AP`, `CP`, `CSC`, and `CSC-HOME` (if available).
4. **Load firmware files into Odin**:
   - Add each extracted file to its corresponding section in Odin.
   - Note: Some files may take time to load, and Odin may freeze temporarily. Just wait!
5. **Choose CSC or CSC-HOME:**
   - `CSC` will **factory reset** your phone (erases all data).
   - `CSC-HOME` will **install the update** without resetting your phone.
6. **Keep Odin settings as default.** Do not change anything.
7. **Click Start** and wait for the process to complete.
8. Once finished, Odin will display `PASS`, and your phone will reboot.
9. Enjoy.

## Troubleshooting
- **Odin does not detect my device**:
  - Ensure you have installed the correct USB drivers.
  - Try using a different USB cable or port.
  - Reboot your computer and try again.
- **Device still in boot loop**:
  - Try flashing the firmware again, ensuring all files are correctly loaded.
  - If using `CSC-HOME` did not work, try `CSC` (factory reset required).
- **Nothing from the above worked!**:
  - contact samsung.
  - visit a repair shop.
